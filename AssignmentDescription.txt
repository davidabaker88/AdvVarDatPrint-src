//Create a program in IntelliJ  that does the following: 

/* print vs println */
//declare a string variable called stringVar and intitialize it to be the string "Why does Waldo wear a striped shirt? "
//declare a integer variable called myInt and intitialize it to be 10
//declare a string variable called stringVar2 and initialize it to "Because he does not want to be spotted."
//print "the number you entered is: "  and the the value of myInt. followed by a new line using 1 line of code
//print "the number you entered is: "  and the the value of myInt. followed by a new line using 2 lines of code
//for the above do not type 10, use the variable instead. same for the rest of them.
//print the value of stringVar and stringVar2 on 1 line. using 1 line of code
//print the value of stringVar and stringVar2 on 2 lines. using 2 lines of code
//print the value of stringVar and stringVar2 on 1 line. using 2 lines of code

/* declaring types of variables and expressions */
//declare a variable that would hold the number 12.5
//declare an integer and initialize it to 6
//multiply the two variables that you just created and put the result into a new variable caled "result"

//declare an integer variable called "num1" and initialize it to be 10
//declare an integer variable called "num2" and initialize it to be 3
//divide num1 by num2 and put the result into a new integer variable called resultTest1
//divide num1 by num2 and put the result into a new double variable called resultTest2
//print "resultTest1: " and the value of resultTest1 on one line  
//print "resultTest2: " and the value of resultTest2 on one line  

/*Look at the results, do the values for resultTest1 and resultTest2 make sense?  Why does this happen?- Will be part of explanation*/
